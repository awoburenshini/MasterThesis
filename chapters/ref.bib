Our method first outputs a dense, temporally coherent, regularized point set from a coarse particle-based liquid simulation. We then apply a surface-only Lagrangian wave simulation to this high-resolution point set. We develop novel methods for seeding and simulating waves over surface points, and use them to generate high-resolution details. We avoid error-prone surface mesh processing, and robustly propagate waves without the need for explicit connectivity information. Our seeding strategy combines a robust curvature evaluation with multiple bands of seeding oscillators, injects waves with arbitrarily fine-scale structures, and properly handles obstacle boundaries. We generate detailed fluid surfaces from coarse simulations as an independent post-process that can be applied to most particle-based fluid solvers.},

The natural sciences and, in extension, computer graphics, have comprehensively studied the mechanical behavior of films and foams, as well as the optical properties of thin liquid layers. In this paper, we focus on the dynamics of material flow within the soap film, which results in fascinating, extremely detailed patterns. This flow is characterized by a complex coupling between surfactant concentration and Marangoni surface tension. We propose a novel chemomechanical simulation framework rooted in lubrication theory, which makes use of a custom semi-Lagrangian advection solver to enable the simulation of soap film dynamics on spherical bubbles both in free flow as well as under body forces such as gravity or external air flow. By comparing our simulated outcomes to videos of real-world soap bubbles recorded in a studio environment, we show that our framework, for the first time, closely recreates a wide range of dynamic effects that are also observed in experiment.},

Leung, H.K. Zhao, A grid based particle method for moving interface problems, J. Comput. Phys. 228 (2009) 7706–7728]. In particular, we develop implicit time discretization methods for the advection–diffusion equation where the time step is restricted solely by the advection part of the equation. We also generalize the GBPM to solve high order geometrical flows including surface diffusion and Willmore-type flows. The resulting algorithm can be easily implemented since the method is based on meshless particles quasi-uniformly sampled on the interface. Furthermore, without any computational mesh or triangulation defined on the interface, we do not require remeshing or reparametrization in the case of highly distorted motion or when there are topological changes. As an interesting application, we study locally inextensible flows governed by energy minimization. We introduce tension force via a Lagrange multiplier determined by the solution to a Helmholtz equation defined on the evolving interface. Extensive numerical examples are also given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.}

This reduced the dissipation of the original PIC without suffering from the noise present in the historic alternative, Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) [Brackbill and Ruppel 1986]. We present a generalization of APIC by augmenting each particle with a more general local function. By viewing the grid-to-particle transfer as a linear and angular momentum conserving projection of the particle-wise local grid velocities onto a reduced basis, we greatly improve the energy and vorticity conservation over the original APIC. Furthermore, we show that the cost of the generalized projection is negligible over APIC when using a particular class of local polynomial functions. Lastly, we note that our method retains the filtering property of APIC and PIC and thus has similar robustness to noise.},

However, extra zero-level sets or spurious sheets usually emerge in implicit algorithms and damage the reconstruction results. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction approach that involves the total variation (TV) of the implicit representation to minimize the occurrence of spurious sheets. Proof is given to show that the recovered shape has the simplest topology with respect to the input data. By using algebraic spline functions as the implicit representation, an efficient discretization is presented together with effective algorithms to solve it. Hierarchical structures with uniform subdivisions can be applied in the framework for fitting fine details. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves high quality reconstruction results while reducing the existence of extra sheets.}

The surface tension that is calculated on the contact line between the solid surface and liquid surface can then capture all interfacial tensions, including liquid-solid, liquid-air and solid-air tensions. We use a simple dynamic contact angle model to select contact angles according to the solid material property, water history, and the fluid front's motion. Our algorithm robustly and accurately treats various drop shape deformations, and handles both flat and curved solid surfaces.

abstract = {In this study, a new particle method for simulating the dynamics of a liquid droplet in a two-dimensional space has been developed. The proposed method incorporates a moving surface mesh to represent a deformable free-surface boundary. The domain enclosed by the surface mesh is defined as a liquid volume (droplet), and the outer region is a gas phase with constant pressure. Fluid particles are seeded inside the liquid domain, and also, discrete nodes along the surface mesh are defined as additional computational points. The incompressible flow is solved based on the LSMPS (least squares moving particle semi-implicit) method, where all differential operators are discretized by means of consistent schemes. The stress balance equations are solved along free surfaces, where the surface tension force is directly evaluated by the geometry of the surface mesh at each surface node. As numerical tests, various problems including a hydrostatic pressure problem, circular and square patch tests, droplet oscillations and static droplets suspended by solid walls have been simulated. As a result, the proposed method shows excellent agreement with the reference solutions, even under large free-surface deformations, which verifies the validity of the current developments.}

The basic idea of Moving Least Square (MLS) has also been used in computer graphics to estimate deformation gradient for deformable solids. Based on these previous studies, we propose a multiphase MLSRK framework that animates complex and coupled fluids and solids in a unified manner. Specifically, we use the Cauchy momentum equation and phase field model to uniformly capture the momentum balance and phase evolution/interaction in a multiphase system, and systematically formulate the MLSRK discretization to support general multiphase constitutive models. A series of animation examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of our new multiphase MLSRK framework, including hyperelastic, elastoplastic, viscous, fracturing and multiphase coupling behaviours etc.},

abstract = {This paper explores how core problems in PDE-based geometry processing can be efficiently and reliably solved via grid-free Monte Carlo methods. Modern geometric algorithms often need to solve Poisson-like equations on geometrically intricate domains. Conventional methods most often mesh the domain, which is both challenging and expensive for geometry with fine details or imperfections (holes, self-intersections, etc.). In contrast, grid-free Monte Carlo methods avoid mesh generation entirely, and instead just evaluate closest point queries. They hence do not discretize space, time, nor even function spaces, and provide the exact solution (in expectation) even on extremely challenging models. More broadly, they share many benefits with Monte Carlo methods from photorealistic rendering: excellent scaling, trivial parallel implementation, view-dependent evaluation, and the ability to work with any kind of geometry (including implicit or procedural descriptions). We develop a complete "black box" solver that encompasses integration, variance reduction, and visualization, and explore how it can be used for various geometry processing tasks. In particular, we consider several fundamental linear elliptic PDEs with constant coefficients on solid regions of Rn. Overall we find that Monte Carlo methods significantly broaden the horizons of geometry processing, since they easily handle problems of size and complexity that are essentially hopeless for conventional methods.},

A direct numerical simulation of films and foams via the Navier-Stokes equations is still computationally too expensive. We propose an alternative formulation inspired by geometric flow. Our model exploits the fact, according to Plateau's laws, that the steady state of a film is a union of constant mean curvature surfaces and minimal surfaces. Such surfaces are also well known as the steady state solutions of certain curvature flows. We show a link between the Navier-Stokes equations and a recent variant of mean curvature flow, called hyperbolic mean curvature flow, under the assumption of constant air pressure per enclosed region. Instead of using hyperbolic mean curvature flow as is, we propose to replace curvature by the gradient of the surface area functional. This formulation enables us to robustly handle non-manifold configurations; such junctions connecting multiple films are intractable with the traditional formulation using curvature. We also add explicit volume preservation to hyperbolic mean curvature flow, which in fact corresponds to the pressure term of the Navier-Stokes equations. Our method is simple, fast, robust, and consistent with Plateau's laws, which are all due to our reformulation of film dynamics as a geometric flow.},

In contrast to most particle-based free-surface detection methods, which perform the surface identification based on physical and geometrical properties derived from the underlying fluid flow simulation, the proposed approach only demands the spatial location of the particles to properly recognize surface particles, avoiding even the use of kernels. Boundary particles are identified through a Hidden Point Removal (HPR) operator used for visibility test. Our method is very simple, fast, easy to implement and robust to changes in the distribution of particles, even when facing large deformation of the free-surface. A set of comparisons against state-of-the-art boundary detection methods show the effectiveness of our approach. The good performance of our method is also attested in the context of fluid flow simulation involving free-surface, mainly when using level-sets for rendering purposes.},

In these methods, particles are used to resolve transport and topological change, while a background Eulerian grid is used for computing mechanical forces and collision responses. Particle-in-Cell (PIC) techniques, particularly the Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) variants have become the norm in computer graphics calculations. While these approaches have proven very powerful, they do suffer from some well known limitations. The original PIC is stable, but highly dissipative, while FLIP, designed to remove this dissipation, is more noisy and at times, unstable. We present a novel technique designed to retain the stability of the original PIC, without suffering from the noise and instability of FLIP. Our primary observation is that the dissipation in the original PIC results from a loss of information when transferring between grid and particle representations. We prevent this loss of information by augmenting each particle with a locally affine, rather than locally constant, description of the velocity. We show that this not only stably removes the dissipation of PIC, but that it also allows for exact conservation of angular momentum across the transfers between particles and grid.},

APIC represents particle velocities as locally affine, rather than locally constant as in traditional PIC. We show that this representation allows APIC to conserve linear and angular momentum across transfers while also dramatically reducing numerical diffusion usually associated with PIC. Notably, conservation is achieved with lumped mass, as opposed to the more commonly used Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) [2], [3] transfers which require a “full” mass matrix for exact conservation. Furthermore, unlike FLIP, APIC retains a filtering property of the original PIC and thus does not accumulate velocity modes on particles as FLIP does. In particular, we demonstrate that APIC does not experience velocity noise that is characteristic of FLIP in a number of Material Point Method (MPM) hyperelasticity calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate that when combined with the midpoint rule for implicit update of grid momentum that linear and angular momentum are exactly conserved.}

abstract = {We propose a novel scheme for simulating two-way coupled interactions between nonlinear elastic solids and incompressible fluids. The key ingredient of this approach is a ghost matrix operator-splitting scheme for strongly coupled nonlinear elastica and incompressible fluids through the weak form of their governing equations. This leads to a stable and efficient method handling large time steps under the CFL limit while using a single monolithic solve for the coupled pressure fields, even in the case with highly nonlinear elastic solids. The use of the Material Point Method (MPM) is essential in the designing of the scheme, it not only preserves discretization consistency with the hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian fluid solver, but also works naturally with our novel interface quadrature (IQ) discretization for free-slip boundary conditions. While traditional MPM suffers from sticky numerical artifacts, our framework naturally supports discontinuous tangential velocities at the solid-fluid interface. Our IQ discretization results in an easy-to-implement, fully particle-based treatment of the interfacial boundary, avoiding the additional complexities associated with intermediate level set or explicit mesh representations. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is verified by various challenging simulations with fluid-elastica interactions.},

At the center of our approach is a meshless Lagrangian description of the different types of codimensional geometries and their transitions using an MLS approximation. In particular, we differentiate the codimension-1 and codimension-2 geometries on Lagrangian MLS particles to precisely describe the evolution of thin sheets and filaments, and we discretize the codimension-0 operators on a background Cartesian grid for efficient volumetric processing. Physical forces including surface tension and pressure across different codimensions are coupled in a monolithic manner by solving one single linear system to evolve the surface-tension driven Navier-Stokes system in a complex non-manifold space. The codimensional transitions are handled explicitly by tracking a codimension number stored on each particle, which replaces the tedious meshing operators in a conventional mesh-based approach. Using the proposed framework, we simulate a broad array of visually appealing surface tension phenomena, including the fluid chain, bell, polygon, catenoid, and dripping, to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in capturing the complex fluid characteristics with mixed codimensions, in a robust, versatile, and connectivity-free manner.},

abstract = {We present a novel Material Point Method (MPM) discretization of surface tension forces that arise from spatially varying surface energies. These variations typically arise from surface energy dependence on temperature and/or concentration. Furthermore, since the surface energy is an interfacial property depending on the types of materials on either side of an interface, spatial variation is required for modeling the contact angle at the triple junction between a liquid, solid and surrounding air. Our discretization is based on the surface energy itself, rather than on the associated traction condition most commonly used for discretization with particle methods. Our energy based approach automatically captures surface gradients without the explicit need to resolve them as in traction condition based approaches. We include an implicit discretization of thermomechanical material coupling with a novel particle-based enforcement of Robin boundary conditions associated with convective heating. Lastly, we design a particle resampling approach needed to achieve perfect conservation of linear and angular momentum with Affine-Particle-In-Cell (APIC) [Jiang et al. 2015]. We show that our approach enables implicit time stepping for complex behaviors like the Marangoni effect and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.

The potential energy associated with surface tension is proportional to the surface area of the liquid. We design discrete forces as gradients of this energy with respect to the motion of the fluid over a time step. We show that this naturally allows for inversion of the Hessian of the potential energy required with the use of Newton's method to solve the systems of nonlinear equations associated with implicit time stepping. The rotational invariance of the surface tension energy makes it non-convex and we define a definiteness fix procedure as in [Teran et al. 2005].

Our approach works most naturally with Particle-In-Cell [Harlow 1964] techniques and we demonstrate our approach with a weakly incompressible model for liquid discretized with the Material Point Method [Sulsky et al. 1994].

We use a two-grid Material Point Method to discretize the governing equations. The momentum exchange term in the mixture theory is relatively stiff and we use semi-implicit time stepping to avoid associated small time steps. Our semi-implicit treatment is explicit in plasticity and preserves symmetry of force linearizations. We develop a novel regularization of the elastic part of the sand constitutive model that better mimics plasticity during the implicit solve to prevent numerical cohesion artifacts that would otherwise have occurred.

We therefore propose a novel multi-component simulation framework that treats many of the key physical mechanisms governing the dynamics of wet hair. The foundations of our approach are a discrete rod model for hair and a particle-in-cell model for fluids. To treat the thin layer of liquid that clings to the hair, we augment each hair strand with a height field representation. Our contribution is to develop the necessary physical and numerical models to evolve this new system and the interactions among its components. We develop a new reduced-dimensional liquid model to solve the motion of the liquid along the length of each hair, while accounting for its moving reference frame and influence on the hair dynamics. We derive a faithful model for surface tension-induced cohesion effects between adjacent hairs, based on the geometry of the liquid bridges that connect them. We adopt an empirically-validated drag model to treat the effects of coarse-scale interactions between hair and surrounding fluid, and propose new volume-conserving dripping and absorption strategies to transfer liquid between the reduced and particle-in-cell liquid representations. The synthesis of these techniques yields an effective wet hair simulator, which we use to animate hair flipping, an animal shaking itself dry, a spinning car wash roller brush dunked in liquid, and intricate hair coalescence effects, among several additional scenarios.},

abstract = {We propose to enhance the capability of standard free-surface flow simulators with efficient support for immersed bubbles through two new models: constraint-based bubbles and affine fluid regions. Unlike its predecessors, our constraint-based model entirely dispenses with the need for advection or projection inside zero-density bubbles, with extremely modest additional computational overhead that is proportional to the surface area of all bubbles. This surface-only approach is easy to implement, realistically captures many familiar bubble behaviors, and even allows two or more distinct liquid bodies to correctly interact across completely unsimulated air. We augment this model with a per-bubble volume-tracking and correction framework to minimize the cumulative effects of gradual volume drift. To support bubbles with non-zero densities, we propose a novel reduced model for an irregular fluid region with a single pointwise incompressible affine vector field. This model requires only 11 interior velocity degrees of freedom per affine fluid region in 3D, and correctly reproduces buoyant, stationary, and sinking behaviors of a secondary fluid phase with non-zero density immersed in water. Since the pressure projection step in both the above schemes is a slightly modified Poisson-style system, we propose novel Multigrid-based preconditioners for Conjugate Gradients for fast numerical solutions of our new discretizations. Furthermore, we observe that by enforcing an incompressible affine vector field over a coalesced set of grid cells, our reduced model is effectively an irregular coarse super-cell. This offers a convenient and flexible adaptive coarsening strategy that integrates readily with the standard staggered grid approach for fluid simulation, yet supports coarsened regions that are arbitrary voxelized shapes, and provides an analytically divergence-free interior. We demonstrate its effectiveness with a new adaptive liquid simulator whose interior regions are coarsened into a mix of tiles with regular and irregular shapes.},

abstract = {Simulating the physical behaviors of deformable objects and fluids has been an important topic in computer graphics. While the Lagrangian Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used for elasto-plastic solids, it usually requires additional computational components in the case of large deformation, mesh distortion, fracture, self-collision and coupling between materials. Often, special solvers and strategies need to be developed for a particular problem. Recently, the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method (MPM) was introduced to the graphics community. It uses a continuum description of the governing equations and utilizes user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive models. The hybrid nature of MPM allows using a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. Like other particle methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), topology change is easy due to the lack of explicit connectivity between Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, MPM allows a grid-based implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. MPM also provides a unified particle simulation framework similar to Position Based Dynamics (PBD) for easy coupling of different materials. The power of MPM has been demonstrated in a number of recent papers for simulating various materials including elastic objects, snow, lava, sand and viscoelastic fluids. It is also highly integrated into the production framework of Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been used in featured animations including Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.},

Consequently, this paper presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture.

abstract = {We have developed a novel hierarchical data structure for the efficient representation of sparse, time-varying volumetric data discretized on a 3D grid. Our “VDB”, so named because it is a Volumetric, Dynamic grid that shares several characteristics with B+trees, exploits spatial coherency of time-varying data to separately and compactly encode data values and grid topology. VDB models a virtually infinite 3D index space that allows for cache-coherent and fast data access into sparse volumes of high resolution. It imposes no topology restrictions on the sparsity of the volumetric data, and it supports fast (average O(1)) random access patterns when the data are inserted, retrieved, or deleted. This is in contrast to most existing sparse volumetric data structures, which assume either static or manifold topology and require specific data access patterns to compensate for slow random access. Since the VDB data structure is fundamentally hierarchical, it also facilitates adaptive grid sampling, and the inherent acceleration structure leads to fast algorithms that are well-suited for simulations. As such, VDB has proven useful for several applications that call for large, sparse, animated volumes, for example, level set dynamics and cloud modeling. In this article, we showcase some of these algorithms and compare VDB with existing, state-of-the-art data structures.},

abstract = {The typical elastic surface or curve simulation method takes a Lagrangian approach and consists of three components: time integration, collision detection and collision response. The Lagrangian view is beneficial because it naturally allows for tracking of the codimensional manifold, however collision must then be detected and resolved separately. Eulerian methods are promising alternatives because collision processing is automatic and while this is effective for volumetric objects, advection of a codimensional manifold is too inaccurate in practice. We propose a novel hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian approach that preserves the best aspects of both views. Similar to the Drucker-Prager and Mohr-Coulomb models for granular materials, we define our collision response with a novel elastoplastic constitutive model. To achieve this, we design an anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive model that separately characterizes the response to manifold strain as well as shearing and compression in the directions orthogonal to the manifold. We discretize the model with the Material Point Method and a novel codimensional Lagrangian/Eulerian update of the deformation gradient. Collision intensive scenarios with millions of degrees of freedom require only a few minutes per frame and examples with up to one million degrees of freedom run in less than thirty seconds per frame.},

We present a new method which treats both air and liquid as incompressible, more accurately reproducing the reality observed at scales relevant to computer animation. The Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) method, already shown to effectively simulate incompressible fluids with low numerical dissipation, is extended to two-phase flow by associating a phase bit with each particle. The liquid surface is reproduced at each time step from the particle positions, which are adjusted to prevent mixing near the surface and to allow for accurate surface tension. The liquid surface is adjusted around small-scale features so they are represented in the grid-based pressure projection, while separate, loosely coupled velocity fields reduce unwanted influence between the phases. The resulting scheme is easy to implement, requires little parameter tuning, and is shown to reproduce lively two-phase fluid phenomena.},

We design our discretization from the upper convected derivative terms in the evolution of the left Cauchy-Green elastic strain tensor. We combine this with an Oldroyd-B model for plastic flow in a complex viscoelastic fluid. While the Oldroyd-B model is traditionally used for viscoelastic fluids, we show that its interpretation as a plastic flow naturally allows us to simulate a wide range of complex material behaviors. In order to do this, we provide a modification to the traditional Oldroyd-B model that guarantees volume preserving plastic flows. Our plasticity model is remarkably simple (foregoing the need for the singular value decomposition (SVD) of stresses or strains). Lastly, we show that implicit time stepping can be achieved in a manner similar to [Stomakhin et al. 2013] and that this allows for high resolution simulations at practical simulation times.},

We develop a novel thermomechanical model using mixture theory to resolve interactions between individual water, gas and dough species. Heat transfer with thermal expansion is used to model thermal variations in material properties. Water-based mass transfer is resolved through the porous mixture, gas represents carbon dioxide produced by leavening agents in the baking process and dough is modeled as a viscoelastoplastic solid to represent its varied and complex rheological properties. Water content in the mixture reduces during the baking process according to Fick's Law which contributes to drying and cracking of crust at the material boundary. Carbon dioxide gas produced by leavening agents during baking creates internal pressure that causes rising. The viscoelastoplastic model for the dough is temperature dependent and is used to model melting and solidification. We discretize the governing equations using a novel Material Point Method designed to track the solid phase of the mixture.},

abstract = {Realistic handling of fluid-air and fluid-solid interfaces in SPH is a challenging problem. The main reason is that some important physical phenomena such as surface tension and adhesion emerge as a result of inter-molecular forces in a microscopic scale. This is different from scalar fields such as fluid pressure, which can be plausibly evaluated on a macroscopic scale using particles. Although there exist techniques to address this problem for some specific simulation scenarios, there does not yet exist a general approach to reproduce the variety of effects that emerge in reality from fluid-air and fluid-solid interactions. In order to address this problem, we present a new surface tension force and a new adhesion force. Different from the existing work, our surface tension force can handle large surface tensions in a realistic way. This property lets our approach handle challenging real scenarios, such as water crown formation, various types of fluid-solid interactions, and even droplet simulations. Furthermore, it prevents particle clustering at the free surface where inter-particle pressure forces are incorrect. Our adhesion force allows plausible two-way attraction of fluids and solids and can be used to model different wetting conditions. By using our forces, modeling surface tension and adhesion effects do not require involved techniques such as generating a ghost air phase or surface tracking. The forces are applied to the neighboring fluid-fluid and fluid-boundary particle pairs in a symmetric way, which satisfies momentum conservation. We demonstrate that combining both forces allows simulating a variety of interesting effects in a plausible way.},

abstract = {We devise a novel surface-only approach for simulating the three dimensional free-surface flow of incompressible, inviscid, and linearly magnetizable ferrofluids. A Lagrangian velocity field is stored on a triangle mesh capturing the fluid's surface. The two key problems associated with the dynamic simulation of the fluid's interesting geometry are the magnetization process transitioning the fluid from a non-magnetic into a magnetic material, and the evaluation of magnetic forces. In this regard, our key observation is that for linearly incompressible ferrofluids, their magnetization and application of magnetic forces only require knowledge about the position of the fluids' boundary. Consequently, our approach employs a boundary element method solving the magnetization problem and evaluating the so-called magnetic pressure required for the force evaluation. The magnetic pressure is added to the Dirichlet boundary condition of a surface-only liquids solver carrying out the dynamical simulation. By only considering the fluid's surface in contrast to its whole volume, we end up with an efficient approach enabling more complex and realistic ferrofluids to be explored in the digital domain without compromising efficiency. Our approach allows for the use of physical parameters leading to accurate simulations as demonstrated in qualitative and quantitative evaluations.},

abstract = {The power crust is a construction which takes a sample of points from the surface of a three-dimensional object and produces a surface mesh and an approximate medial axis. The approach is to first approximate the medial axis transform (MAT) of the object. We then use an inverse transform to produce the surface representation from the MAT.This idea leads to a simple algorithm with theoretical guarantees comparable to those of other surface reconstruction and medial axis approximation algorithms. It also comes with a guarantee that does not depend in any way on the quality of the input point sample. Any input gives an output surface which is the `watertight' boundary of a three-dimensional polyhedral solid: the solid described by the approximate MAT. This unconditional guarantee makes the algorithm quite robust and eliminates the polygonalization, hole-filling or manifold extraction post-processing steps required in previous surface reconstruction algorithms.In this paper, we use the theory to develop a power crust implementation which is indeed robust for realistic and even difficult samples. We describe the careful design of a key subroutine which labels parts of the MAT as inside or outside of the object, easy in theory but non-trivial in practice. We find that we can handle areas in which the input sampling is scanty or noisy by simply discarding the unreliable parts of the MAT approximation. We demonstrate good empirical results on inputs including models with sharp corners, sparse and unevenly distributed point samples, holes, and noise, both natural and synthetic.We also demonstrate some simple extensions: intentionally leaving holes where there is no data, producing approximate offset surfaces, and simplifying the approximate MAT in a principled way to preserve stable features.},

abstract = {Recently in the field of computer vision, there have been many attempts to obtain a symbolic shape description of an object by fitting simple primitives to the range data of the object. In this paper, we introduce the "Blobby Model" for automatically generating a shape description from range data. This model can express a 3D surface as an isosurface of a scalar field which is produced by a number of field generating primitives. The fields from many primitives are blended with each other and can form a very complicated shape. To determine the number and distribution of primitives required to adequately represent a complex 3D surface, an energy function is minimized which measures the shape difference between the range data and the "Blobby Model". We start with a single primitive and introduce more primitives by splitting each primitive into two further primitives so as to reduce the energy value. In this manner, the shape of the 3D object is slowly recovered as the isosurface produced by many primitives. We have successfully applied this method to human face range data and typical results are shown. The method herein does not require any prior range segmentation.},

An object's surface is defined implicitly as the zero set of an RBF fitted to the given surface data. Fast methods for fitting and evaluating RBFs allow us to model large data sets, consisting of millions of surface points, by a single RBF — previously an impossible task. A greedy algorithm in the fitting process reduces the number of RBF centers required to represent a surface and results in significant compression and further computational advantages. The energy-minimisation characterisation of polyharmonic splines result in a “smoothest” interpolant. This scale-independent characterisation is well-suited to reconstructing surfaces from non-uniformly sampled data. Holes are smoothly filled and surfaces smoothly extrapolated. We use a non-interpolating approximation when the data is noisy. The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically. This helps generate uniform meshes and we show that the RBF representation has advantages for mesh simplification and remeshing applications. Results are presented for real-world rangefinder data.},

The definition has a number of appealing features: it uses a single parameter (parameter-free for exact interpolation), applies to any dimensions, commutes with similarity transformations, and can be easily implemented without discretizing the space. More importantly, the use of a global smoothness energy allows our definition to be much more resilient to sampling imperfections than existing methods, making it particularly suited for sparse and non-uniform inputs.},

abstract = {We describe algebraic methods for creating implicit surfaces using linear combinations of radial basis interpolants to form complex models from scattered surface points. Shapes with arbitrary topology are easily represented without the usual interpolation or aliasing errors arising from discrete sampling. These methods were first applied to implicit surfaces by Savchenko, et al. and later developed independently by Turk and O'Brien as a means of performing shape interpolation. Earlier approaches were limited as a modeling mechanism because of the order of the computational complexity involved. We explore and extend these implicit interpolating methods to make them suitable for systems of large numbers of scattered surface points by using compactly supported radial basis interpolants. The use of compactly supported elements generates a sparse solution space, reducing the computational complexity and making the technique practical for large models. The local nature of compactly supported radial basis functions permits the use of computational techniques and data structures such as k-d trees for spatial subdivision, promoting fast solvers and methods to divide and conquer many of the subproblems associated with these methods. Moreover, the representation of complex models permits the exploration of diverse surface geometry. This reduction in computational complexity enables the application of these methods to the study of shape properties of large complex shapes.},

A PHT-spline is a piece-wise tricubic polynomial over a 3D hierarchical T-mesh, the basis functions of which have good properties such as non-negativity, compact support and partition of unity. Given a point cloud, an implicit PHT-spline surface is constructed by interpolating the Hermitian information at the basis vertices of the T-mesh, and the Hermitian information is obtained by estimating the geometric quantities on the underlying surface of the point cloud. We use the natural hierarchical structure of PHT-splines to reconstruct surfaces adaptively, with simple error-guided local refinements that adapt to the regional geometric details of the target object. Unlike some previous methods that heavily depend on the normal information of the point cloud, our approach only uses it for orientation and is insensitive to the noise of normals. Examples show that our approach can produce high quality reconstruction surfaces very efficiently.},

However, sparsely sampled thin features are difficult to simulate in SPH-based free surface flows, due to a number of robustness and stability issues. In this article, we address this problem from two perspectives: the robustness of surface forces and the numerical instability of thin features. We present a new surface tension force scheme based on a free surface energy functional, under the diffuse interface model. We develop an efficient way to calculate the air pressure force for free surface flows, without using air particles. Compared with previous surface force formulae, our formulae are more robust against particle sparsity in thin feature cases. To avoid numerical instability on thin features, we propose to adjust the internal pressure force by estimating the internal pressure at two scales and filtering the force using a geometry-aware anisotropic kernel. Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms in handling a variety of sparsely sampled thin liquid features, including thin sheets, thin jets, and water splashes.},
